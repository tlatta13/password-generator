# Password Generator Project

## Project criteria
* This project required us to create an application that generates a random password for employees with access to sensitive data. To accomplish this, we were required to use our knowledge of javascript to call upon arrays, prompt users to select options and use the user input to generate a new password. 

## Key accomplishments
* Prompted enter password length and select if they wanted special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and numbers. 
* Created a while loop to reprompt the user to enter a password length if the input was less than 8, higher than 128 or no input. 
* Connect all js code to run when the generate password button is pushed.

### Notes
* I was not able to ensure at least one variable was included in the password when all options selected. However, upon running a sample of 100 password generations, the generator returned a correct password 75% of the time. Out of the 25% of password, all were only missing 1 variable.
