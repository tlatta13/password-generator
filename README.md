# Password Generator Project

## Project criteria
* This project required us to create an application that generates a random password for employees with access to sensitive data. To accomplish this, we were required to use our knowledge of javascript to call upon arrays, prompt users to select options and use the user input to generate a new password. 

## Key accomplishments
* Prompted enter password length and select if they wanted special characters, uppercase letters, lowercase letters and numbers. 
* Created a loop to reprompt the user to enter a password length if the input was less than 8, higher than 128, a non-number or no input. 
* Created a loop to reprompt the user if they didn't choose at least one character input.
* Connect all js code to run when the generate password button is pushed.
